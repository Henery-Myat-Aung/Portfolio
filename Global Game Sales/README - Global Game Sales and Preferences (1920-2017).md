## Global Video Game Sales & Preferences (1980–2017)

### Project Overview
This project analyzes global video game sales data from 1980 to 2017 to uncover trends in consumer preferences across **regions, genres, and time periods**.  
The main question was:  
**“What does the gaming industry want, and where are the biggest opportunities for developers and publishers?”**

---

### Key Questions
- What are the **most popular game genres globally**?  
- How do **regional preferences** (NA, EU, JP, Other) differ?  
- How have **genre preferences changed over time** (1990s vs 2000s vs 2010s)?  
- Which publishers have led the market, and why?  
- What are the **recommendations** for publishers and investors?  

---

### Key Insights
- **Action, Sports, and Shooter games** dominate globally, especially in NA and EU.  
- **Japan strongly prefers Role-Playing games**, showing major regional differences.  
- The 1990s were dominated by **Platform games**, while post-2000s shifted to Action and Miscellaneous genres.  
- **Nintendo** showed a strong game-to-revenue ratio, outperforming many competitors.  
- Market potential is untapped in regions outside NA/EU, though sales volumes are smaller.  

---

### Business Implications
- **Regional Strategy:** Publishers should **tailor releases by region** (e.g., RPGs for Japan, Action/Shooters for NA/EU).  
- **Marketing & Expansion:** Promote in underdeveloped regions and highlight genre-specific opportunities.  
- **Localization:** Western publishers can learn from Japanese publishers’ global success, especially in the Japanese market.  
- **Genre Investment:** High-capacity studios should focus on Action/Shooter; smaller studios may succeed in niche genres with less competition.
