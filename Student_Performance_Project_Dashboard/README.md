## Project Overview
This project features an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze the factors affecting student academic performance. Using a dataset of 1,000 students, the dashboard explores the correlation between demographic data (gender, ethnicity), socio-economic indicators (lunch programs), and academic interventions (test preparation courses).

The goal is to provide educators and administrators with actionable insights into which student groups require additional support and how preparation courses impact final scores.

## Key Insights & Features

### 1. Academic Success Overview
* **High Pass Rate:** The student body maintains a **93.5% pass rate**, with average scores across Math, Reading, and Writing hovering around the **66-68** range.
* **The Preparation Gap:** Only **35.8% of students** completed a test preparation course.
* **Gender Distribution:** The dataset is well-balanced, with **51.8% female** and **48.2% male** students.

### 2. Socio-Economic Impact (Lunch Program)
* **Performance Variance:** Students with "Standard" lunch consistently outperform those on "Free/Reduced" lunch across all three subjects.
* **Metric Insight:** The average Math score for the standard lunch group is **~70**, compared to **~58** for the free/reduced group, highlighting a significant socio-economic performance gap.

### 3. Intervention Effectiveness (Test Prep)
* **Score Boost:** Students who **completed** the test preparation course scored significantly higher (avg. Writing score of **74.4**) compared to those who took **none** (avg. Writing score of **64.5**).
* **Takeaway:** Academic interventions show a clear **10-point advantage** in writing and reading proficiency.

### 4. Demographic Analysis (Race/Ethnicity)
* **Group Performance:** **Group E** consistently shows the highest average scores across all categories, followed by Group D.
* **Target Areas:** Group A shows the lowest average scores, suggesting a need for localized academic support or resource allocation.

## Tech Stack
* **Tool:** Power BI Desktop
* **Data Source:** Student Performance Dataset (CSV)
* **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, DAX Measures for Pass/Fail logic, and Cross-Filtering for demographic deep-dives.

## Dashboard Layout
* **Top Ribbon:** High-level KPIs (Total Students, Pass %, Prep Rate).
* **Left Panel:** Slicers for Ethnicity (Groups A-E).
* **Center Visuals:** Bar charts comparing scores by Lunch status and Test Prep completion.
* **Right Panel:** Detailed breakdown of scores by Class/Group.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Increase Test Prep Enrollment:** Given the 10-point score increase, the school should aim to move the "Test Prepared Rate" from 35% to at least 50%.
2. **Support for Reduced Lunch Groups:** Implement targeted tutoring for students in the free/reduced lunch category to bridge the 12-point performance gap.
3. **Focus on Group A:** Prioritize resources for Ethnicity Group A to bring their averages in line with the school-wide mean.
