This project is the analysis of a bike share company located in San Francisco. The company provides bikes that can be rented through a mobile app.  

The main business question was:  
**"How do Casual Riders and Annual Members use Cyclistic/Divvy Bikes differently?"**

### Key Findings
- Although the membership plan is more cost-effective, **casual riders still account for over 36% of all rides**.  
- Casual riders tend to use bikes **more frequently on weekends** and for **longer trip durations**.  
- Annual members primarily use bikes for **weekday commuting**, with shorter and more consistent ride lengths.  
- Station usage patterns also differ: casual riders often start rides near **tourist or leisure areas**, while annual members are concentrated around **residential and business districts**.  

### Business Implications
- There is a strong opportunity to **convert casual riders into members** by highlighting the long-term cost savings of membership.  
- Marketing campaigns could target **weekend riders** with promotions or trial memberships.  
- Improving visibility of membership benefits in the **mobile app at tourist-heavy stations** may help increase conversions.  

### Tools & Skills Used
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** SQL and Excel for handling missing values, date-time formatting, and trip duration calculations.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for summarizing and visualizing ride patterns.  
- **Visualization & Storytelling:** Tableau dashboards to illustrate ride frequency, trip duration, and usage by time of day.
