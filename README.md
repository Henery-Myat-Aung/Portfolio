My Data Analysis Portfolio

ðŸ“Š Aspiring Data Analyst | Business Graduate | Google Data Analytics Certified

Hi! I'm Htet Myat Aung (Henery) â€” a Business Administration graduate with First Class Honours in International Business Management from the University of Hertfordshire. I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and have been actively building hands-on projects to grow my data skills.

My background in administrative work and reporting sparked a deep interest in using data to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working with SQL, Excel, Tableau, and R, and I'm currently exploring Python and BigQuery.

Here on GitHub, you'll find:

ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory data analysis projects

ðŸ“Š Business insights drawn from public datasets

ðŸ“Œ SQL queries and reporting logic used in real scenarios

ðŸš² A recent project using San Francisco Bike Share data to guide station planning decisions

I'm eager to keep learning and contribute to data-driven teams. Feel free to explore my work or connect with me on LinkedIn or by email at htetmyat.henery@gmail.com.
